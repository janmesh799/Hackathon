This is the repository for my website designed for hackathon - (Hack the web) organised by IIIT Jabalpur.
website hosting link:- https://janmesh7.github.io/Hackathon/

At homepage there is the title - Quiz game and some sets of rules are also there on the same page.
At the top left corner there is a logo of Programming club (BIT-BYTE) of my college - IIIT Jabalpur, 
When we click on it, it takes us to the homepage of the website of programming club.

Homepage of my website looks like this->

When I hover the (SELECT TOPIC) button it changes its colour and becomes darker.

When I click the (SELECT TOPIC) Button, it takes me to a new webpage in the same tab to choose some topics.

My Select-Topic Webpage looks like this ->

5 topics are listed there.

-> I arranged them in a table format to give a basic design.

-> all the topics are button which are bluish in colour with pinkish shadow.

-> when I hove one of these, then their shadow colour and button colour interchanges
i.e., button becomes pinkish and shadow becomes bluish.

it looks something like this: =
